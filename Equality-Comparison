!==
===
=
> checks that the number on the left is strictly greater than the number on the right.
>= (written as >=) checks that the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right.
< checks that the number on the left is strictly lesser than the number on the right.
<= (written as <=) checks that the number on the left is lesser than or equal to the number on the right.
a > b returns true when a is strictly greater than b
a < b returns true when a is strictly lesser than b
The result of comparisons is always going to be a boolean. Either true or false.
The = operator is always used for assignment.
The === operator (written as ===) is always used for equality comparison.
Confusing = and === is a common mistake. Don't worry!
The !== operator (written as !==) returns true when the 2 numbers given are NOT the same.
